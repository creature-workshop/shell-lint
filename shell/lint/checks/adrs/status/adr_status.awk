# Prints a finding for a decision record whose Status line says anything but
# that the record is approved, or which record superseded it. A record reaches
# the default branch by being approved, so "proposed" there is never true. A
# record with no Status line is adr_shape.awk's to report, and only the header,
# the lines above the first section, is read, so a Status line quoted in an
# example is left alone. Reads one record, named on the command line. Exits 1
# when there is a finding.
