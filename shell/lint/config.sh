: <<'FRAGMENT'
The repository's lint settings: the lint declaration, .ops/config/lint.yaml,
or $PROJ/lint.json while the repository has not converted.

The declaration is read once per run, checked against lint.schema.json, and
handed to every check inside its options as `.config`. It is optional, and
so is every key in it: each reader here has a default, so a repository with
no declaration gets the house settings. To add a setting, add it to the
schema and add a reader here; the schema is what tells a repository its
declaration is wrong.

The read goes through shellops' config module when the shellops the host
runs on has one, so the lint and the resolver agree on where a declaration
is and how it is read; otherwise the lint reads the YAML through SILT, in
the strata tree that SILT_DIR points to, and the JSON through the structs
API.

: <<'PUB_FUN'
Prints the repository's lint settings as a struct, checked against
lint.schema.json: the declaration .ops/config/lint.yaml when the repository
has one, else $PROJ/lint.json, else an empty object. A declaration that
does not parse, or that breaks the schema, fails the call and says why. A
named file is read as JSON, for a test or a tool that keeps its settings
elsewhere.

: <<'FUN'
Prints the repository's lint declaration as a struct, unchecked, or nothing
when the repository has none: through shellops' config module when this
shell has one, else the YAML under .ops/config read through SILT, else
$PROJ/lint.json.

: <<'FUN'
Imports shellops' config module when the shellops present has one and this
shell does not define its verbs yet. A shellops without the module leaves
the shell as it is.

: <<'FUN'
Prints true when this shell defines self__config__load, the verb of
shellops' config module, and false otherwise. A test that defines the verb
itself stands in for a shellops that has the module.

: <<'FUN'
Prints the lint declaration as shellops' config module reads it, or
nothing when that module finds none. The module hands a legacy lint.json
over as it is, so one that is not JSON is refused here, naming it.

not.

Prints the YAML file <file> as a struct, read through SILT's translator in
the strata tree that SILT_DIR points to. Fails, saying so, when SILT_DIR
does not point to the library or the file does not parse as YAML.

: <<'FUN'
Makes SILT's verbs present in this shell, sourcing the library from the
strata tree that SILT_DIR points to when they are not yet. Fails, saying
so, when SILT_DIR is unset or does not point to the library.

Prints the lint settings in the JSON file <path> as a struct, checked
against lint.schema.json, or an empty object when the file does not exist.

Prints the directories a repository keeps its own lint checks under, as a
struct array of PROJ-relative paths; empty by default.

Prints true when leading tabs are allowed, false by default.
PUB_FUN
lint__config__allow_tabs() {
  @get "$1" '.indent.tabs' false
}

: <<'PUB_FUN'
Prints the directory names that mark a test tree, as a struct array; test and
tests by default. A file under a directory with one of these names, anywhere
in its path, is in the tests scope.
PUB_FUN
lint__config__test_trees() {
  @get "$1" '.tests' "$(@arr test tests)"
}

: <<'PUB_FUN'
Prints the directories, relative to the repository root, that no check looks
in; a struct array, empty by default.
PUB_FUN
lint__config__excludes() {
  @get "$1" '.exclude' "$(@arr)"
}

: <<'PUB_FUN'
Prints the roots a library file sits under, relative to the repository root,
as a struct array: the list lint.json's library_roots names; otherwise
scripts, shell and src, the homes a consumer keeps its shell in, or lib and
interpreter when the repository is shellops itself, PROJ standing in
SHELLOPS_DIR (ADR 000045). A file under one is a module, its namespace the
path under the root; a consumer's root lib/ is its product's until named.
PUB_FUN
lint__config__library_roots() {
  @get "$1" '.library_roots' "$(__lint__config__default_library_roots)"
}

: <<'FUN'
Prints the library roots a repository has when lint.json names none, as a
struct array: shellops' own when PROJ stands in SHELLOPS_DIR, a consumer's
otherwise.

: <<'PUB_FUN'
Prints the names of the checks that run only under --added-only, as a struct
array; empty by default. A check goes here when the code already has findings
the team is working off: new lines still have to pass it, and a full sweep
leaves it out rather than failing on the old ones.
PUB_FUN
lint__config__added_only_checks() {
  @get "$1" '.added_only' "$(@arr)"

: <<'PUB_FUN'
Prints the directory, relative to the repository root, that holds the
repository's decision records; docs/decisions by default.
PUB_FUN
lint__config__decisions_folder() {

}

: <<'PUB_FUN'
Prints the form the repository holds its decision records to: one-page, or
nothing when the repository names no form.
PUB_FUN
lint__config__decisions_form() {

: <<'PUB_FUN'
Prints how many words of prose a one-page decision record may spend, 450 by
default.

6 by default.
PUB_FUN
lint__config__decisions_number_digits() {
  @get "$1" '.decisions.number_digits' 6

: <<'PUB_FUN'
Prints the pattern that names the CI component templates, relative to the
repository root; templates/*/template.yml by default. A yaml file it does
not match is not a template, and the template checks skip it.
PUB_FUN
lint__config__templates_glob() {
  @get "$1" '.templates.glob' 'templates/*/template.yml'
}

: <<'PUB_FUN'
Prints the base template's path, relative to the repository root: the one
template allowed to define before_script. Nothing by default, which holds
every template to the rule.
PUB_FUN
lint__config__templates_base() {
  @get "$1" '.templates.base' ''
}

: <<'PUB_FUN'
Prints the landing mark as the templates' rules spell it: the text every
rule that matches a merge-request pipeline must contain. Nothing by default,
which turns the job-lands-once check off.
PUB_FUN
lint__config__templates_mark() {
  @get "$1" '.templates.mark' ''
}

: <<'PUB_FUN'
Prints the templates that run on every push to a merge request, marked or
not, as a struct array of paths relative to the repository root; empty by
default. Governance checks and previews go here.
